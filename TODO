Bugs:
* good/ops/em.asm sometimes fails on freshly started fpga with freshly uploaded core (mem map issue?)

Needs investigation:
* How to constrain an asynchronous design?
* IC is cleared on -OFF only? But DTR says 0->IC on CLO!

Keep an eye on:
* IR is loaded on STROB1*W->IR rising edge instead of a latching on high. Data on RDT may be not ready then.
* IR is unsafe when synthesized as a latch.
* LF used to destroy registers >r3 (due to wrong register selection signals?).
* The huge combinatorial loop (gone when AWP is present).
* "UPLOAD FAILED" after compilation sometimes
* AWP: T and M are interdependent and thus need to use the same clock

Possible improvements:
* Clock everything on STROB1/2 and use microops as functions?
* Make the design synchronous?

Features:
* Elwro needs to respond to 'clear'
* MEGA
* DRAM driver
* DRAM cache
* serial system bus
* bus reservation
