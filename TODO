Bugs:
* good/ops/em.asm sometimes fails on freshly started fpga with freshly uploaded core (mem map issue?)

Needs investigation:
* IC is cleared on -OFF only? But DTR says 0->IC on CLO!

Keep an eye on:
* IR is loaded on STROB1*W->IR rising edge instead of a latching on high. Data on RDT may be not ready then.
* IR is unsafe when synthesized as a latch.
* LF used to destroy registers >r3 (due to wrong register selection signals?).
* The huge combinatorial loop.
* "UPLOAD FAILED" after compilation sometimes
* fitter operation takes ages when no logic analyzer is connected (combi loop?)
* everything breaks when no logic analyzer is connected (combi loop?)

Possible improvements:
* Clock everything on STROB1/2 and use microops as functions?

Features:
* Elwro needs to respond to 'clear'
* MEGA
* serial system bus
* bus reservation
